        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
        <p>
            Predicting the potential habitat of species under both current and future climate change
            scenarios is crucial for monitoring invasive species and understanding a species’ response to different
            environmental conditions. Frequently, the only data available on a species is the location of its
            occurrence (presence-only data). Using occurrence records only, two models were used to predict
            the geographical distribution of two destructive invasive termite species, <em>Coptotermes gestroi</em> (Wasmann)
            and <em>Coptotermes formosanus</em> Shiraki. The ﬁrst model uses a Bayesian linear logistic regression
            approach adjusted for presence-only data while the second one is the widely used maximum entropy
            approach (Maxent). Results show that the predicted distributions of both <em>C. gestroi</em> and <em>C. formosanus</em>
            are strongly linked to urban development. The impact of future scenarios such as climate warming and
            population growth on the biotic distribution of both termite species was also assessed. Future climate
            warming seems to affect their projected probability of presence to a lesser extent than population
            growth. The Bayesian logistic approach outperformed Maxent consistently in all models according to
            evaluation criteria such as model sensitivity and ecological realism.
