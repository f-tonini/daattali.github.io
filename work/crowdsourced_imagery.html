        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
        <p>
            As a volunteer and mapster in the Standby Task Force (SBTF), I had the opportunity to work on several crowdsourced humanitarian relief projects.
            In 2011, SBTF mapsters analyzed more than 3,000 individual images and tagged more than 9,000 shelters in the “Afgooye corridor”, an area between Mogadishu and Afgooye 
            that due to war and famine had become one of the largest urban areas in Somalia. The Standby Task Force group supported the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees’s (UNHCR) 
            efforts in Somalia in order to get a better sense of where IDP camps were located and provide better service delivery. Rule-sets and feature-keys for 
            tagging IDP camps were refined prior to the deployment. Volunteers were asked to use the Tomnod platform and the satellite imagery provided in order to 
            spot by human-eye solely and tag IDP shelters and buildings. For more information, read the <a class="pubs" href="http://www.standbytaskforce.org/2011/08/31/somalia-imagery-analysis/">full blog post</a>. 
            In December 2011, the Samoan Government and Samoa HEAL, with the support of the United Nations Platform for 
            Space-based Information for Disaster Management and Emergency Response (UN-SPIDER) ran a simulation of early warning and emergency response to a cyclone. 
            Different groups of volunteers were assigned to different tasks, such as: SMS-email, translation, reports, and geo-location of localities hit by the disaster 
            using open source data portals on the web. For more information, check out the <a class="pubs" href="http://www.standbytaskforce.org/2012/02/04/samoa-simulation-sbtf-after-action-report/">full blog post</a>. On Monday May 20, 2013, a powerful tornado impacted the towns of Moore, Newcastle, 
            and southern portions of Oklahoma City, causing widespread destruction. CrisisMappers launched a crowdsourced effort to analyze satellite imagery and mark damaged buildings in parts 
            of the state of Oklahoma stricken by a F-5 tornado. The web application published by Google Crisis Response is no longer updated nor maintained. Screenshots are reported below.
