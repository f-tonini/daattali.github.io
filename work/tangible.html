        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
        <p>
            Managing landscape-scale environmental problems, such as biological invasions, can be facilitated by integrating realistic geospatial models with user-friendly 
            interfaces that stakeholders can use to make critical management decisions. However, gaps between scientific theory and application have typically 
            limited opportunities for model-based knowledge to reach the stakeholders responsible for problem-solving. To address this challenge, we introduce 
            <a class="pubs" href="https://tangible-landscape.github.io/">Tangible Landscape</a>, an open-source participatory modeling tool providing an interactive, shared arena for consensus-building and development of 
            collaborative solutions for landscape-scale problems. Using Tangible Landscape, stakeholders gather around a geographically realistic 3D visualization 
            and explore management scenarios with instant feedback; users direct model simulations with intuitive tangible gestures and compare alternative strategies 
            with an output dashboard. We applied Tangible Landscape to the complex problem of managing the emerging infectious disease, sudden oak death, in California.
